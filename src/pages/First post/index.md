&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this post I'll introduce what this blog is and what I'm doing with it.
My name is Ryan Hoffmann and I'm a computer science major at Bowling Green State University. 
The goal of this blog is to demonstrate what I've been programming and otherwise what I've been up to in the comptuer science world. 
Up until now I've been mostly working with node.js with a little bit of python and java here and there. 
Right now im currently learning html and css by working on this blog.
